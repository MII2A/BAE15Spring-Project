# BAE15Spring-Project

I had to do this project to test the knowledge achieved during the BAE Training.
The project meant to include all aspects of the modules studied with QA so far. My chosen subject is Drinks which I used for the API - backend and frontend.

## Getting Started

The steps I followed were: read the project specification; attended the workshop with Anoush, started my Sprint, started building my API, caught up with some notions in VSC etc.

### Prerequisites

I needed to install different software such as: Eclipse IDE, MySQL Workbench, Postman, Visual Studio Code etc.

### Installing

For example, for Eclipse, after downloading, I had to preset certain criteria for all future projects such as selecting H2, MySQL etc before creating my BAE project. 

## Running the tests

To run tests, I had to update src/test/java with controllers, entities and services in which I wrote code for JUnit testing. We used H2 and Postman also for some of the testing.
